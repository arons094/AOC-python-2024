As you're about to ask how you can help, the reindeer brings you a blank topographic map of the surrounding area (your puzzle input) and looks up at you excitedly.\n",

For all practical purposes, this means that a hiking trail is any path that starts at height 0, ends at height 9, and always increases by a height of exactly 1 at each step. Hiking trails never include diagonal steps - only up, down, left, or right (from the perspective of the map).\n",

Assembling more fragments of pages, you establish that a trailhead's score is the number of 9-height positions reachable from that trailhead via a hiking trail. In the above example, the single trailhead in the top left corner has a score of 1 because it can reach a single 9 (the one in the bottom left).\n",
